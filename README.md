Hello! I'm Andrea, currently a full-time pre-doc and part-time masters student, doing research in behavioural and social sciences.

I'm interested in learning (the human kind, but the machine kind is alright too), behavioural economics, and commitment mechanisms. 

Very often, I scrutinise package documentation or replication code. Offline, you'll find me painting, baking, or running.
