Hello! I'm Andrea, an incoming PhD student at UCLA Anderson in Behavioral Decision Making.

I'm interested in decision-making, learning (the human kind, but the machine kind is alright too), and commitment mechanisms. 

Very often, I scrutinise package documentation or replication code. Offline, you'll find me painting, baking, or running.
